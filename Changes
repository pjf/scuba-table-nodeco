Revision history for Perl extension Sport::Dive::Tables.

0.01  Mon Dec  6 00:09:10 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X Sport::Dive::Tables

	- Released as SCUBA::Table::NoDeco.

0.02  DATE GOES HERE
	- Expanded test suite to ensure correct behaviour when
	  working with truncated or incomplete dive tabes.

	- Updated test suite to be kinder to older Perls.

	- INCOMPATIBLE: The old max_depth method has been renamed
	  to max_table_depth to better reflect its purpose.  The
	  new max_depth function returns the maximum safe depth
	  given the diver's current group.

	- INCOMPATIBLE: max_time now returns '0' when provided with
	  a depth that is 'too deep'.  Previously, this would throw
	  an exception.

	- Added PADI tables.  These need more testing.

0.03  DATE GOES HERE
	- Expanded test suite to include more PADI specific tests.

	- CRITICAL: Discovered and fixed a programming error in PADI surface
	  tables.  At best these resulted in an error being thrown when used,
	  and at worst the incorrect results may be returned.
