SCUBA::Table::NoDeco - Calculate no-decompression dive times.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SCUBA::Table::NoDeco;

  my $table = SCUBA::Table::NoDeco->new();

  $table->dive(metres => 15, minutes => 30);

  print $table->group,"\n";	# Prints "E"

  $table->surface(minutes => 60);

  print $table->group,"\n";	# Prints "D"

  print $table->max_time(metres => 30),"\n";	# Prints 6

=head1 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER

Do B<NOT> use this module as your sole source of no-decompression dive
times.  This module is intended for use only as a guide to assist in
planning your dives.  B<ALWAYS> calculate and verify your dive times
by hand once you have planned your dives.  If you have a dive
computer, follow its instructions for use.

SCUBA diving involves serious risks of injury or death, and should
only be performed by individuals in good health and with the appropriate
skills and training.  Even when tables are used with proper safety
procedures, decompression sickness may still occur.

The author provides ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY on this module, without
even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose.  Use entirely at your own risk.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the ability to perform useful calculations
using dive-tables, including calculating dive groups and maximum
no-decompression times for repetitive dives.  A selection of tables
are available.  The module assumes that the diver is using air as
their breathing gas.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are provided.

=cut

# There's really 0.3048 feet in a metre, but all the dive tables seem
# to assume a flat 1 ft = 30 cm.  As such, we use the same constant here,
# otherwise we end up with incorrect results.

use constant FEET2METRES => 0.3;

# Less than 10 minutes surface is considered part of the same dive.
use constant MIN_SURFACE_TIME => 10;

# More than MAX_SURFACE_TIME will consider us completely off-gassed.
use constant MAX_SURFACE_TIME => 12*60;

SSI tables are the only ones supported in the present release.

dive calculations is retained.

This method determines and sets the diver's group for the dive information
provided.  If the dive 'falls off' the tables, then an exception is
returned.  This method takes into account the diver's current group,
surface interval, and residual nitrogen time.

If the diver does not have a surface interval of at least 10 minutes,
this will consider the dive to be a continuation of the previous
dive.  The dive times will be added, and the maximum depth of both
dives will be used to calculate the diver's group.

The group method returns the current letter designation representing
the amount of residual nitrogen present in the diver.  The letter
designation is always upper-case.  A diver with no residual nitrogen
has no group, represented by the empty string.

elapsed.
